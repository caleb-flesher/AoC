## About

This is a collection of my solutions for Advent of Code problems I have participated it. These are not meant to be perfect solutions, but rather fun exercises to help me think and have fun with coding.

## Day 4

I added a solution I found interesting that is written in python. I wrote comments throughout for my understanding of what was happening. I understand that this is not the "spirit" of the game, but I am using these more as a learning exercise and review of approaching different problems. At this point in time I'd rather grow and learn from things like this rather than focus on challenging myself.
